* Minimum of 1 damage to status effects; this will allow the bot to see them as shedinja counters
* Better decision logs
* Regenerator to the instruction generation logic
* Technoblast to specialeffects; moved move modification to the first modification; changed healing to only generate an instruction if health recovered is > 0

* A catch to check if the request status code is 404
* Inactive battle modifier function to keep track of time remaining
* Pokemon with similar names to the sets lookup for the battle
* Ou sets


### Changed

* Get to post in error string
* Defending_move lookup to use 'get'; this dictionary will not have a 'category' key if the defending move is a switch
* Acrobatics power to 110 since it is more often used with this power than not
* Double hit moves to have 2x power for proper calculation
* Readme and formatting changes to the login requests
* Team_converter to handle ivs for packed-to-json
* Readme to give a gen7ou battle out of the box
* Module to parse all data from smogon stats page
* A set to determine if the move requires special logic
* The remaining time 
* Depth=1 to re-order the botmoves more optimally
* Lru_cache for caching state transposition
* Heavy imports to functions (they are optional)
* Requirements for nash to its own text file
* Pu sample
* The end of turn instructions to happen independently
* Random battle data if the pokemon is not in the lookup
* The pkmn alive score to be constant
* The config module so the gambit path can be changed

* Python 3.6.9 for heroku (#7)
* Randombattle sets
* Battle preparation and decision logic
* Pokemon nature calc
* Run_battle module
* Randombattle spread for checking choicescarf in randombattles
* Inline code into function and add comment (#11)
* Battle is finished function to state method
* Damagecalc abstraction for stealthrock multiplier
* Accuracy multiplier to instruction generator
* Index=2 instead of final index for last d move
* Dynamax on last pokemon
* Switching instruction logic to incrementally apply instructions
* Trick check and support corrosion and stickyhold
* Non-blitz smogon stats for blitz games
* Team statistics after each battle
* Stat lookups to their gen8 versions
* The bot's active pokemon when a transformation happens since the server could send a nickname
* Helpers module into the engine
* Special_logic_moves; create its own module; add junglehealing
* Knockoff logic; add urshifu to unknown pkmn formes
* python base image and copy gambit binary directly from other container
* Python version to 3.6.13


### Fixed

* Priority setting for prankster and added logic to account for if trickroom is in effect
* Bug where 'boost' and 'self, boost' were always affecting the bot's pokemon, not the attacker
* Bug in instruction generation that was always removing toxic counts from the bot's side only
* Error in psyshock logic; the calculation was accidentally reversed
* Bug where recoil/healing moves caused pokemon to go aboveor below max health
* Bug where regenerator acgivated on 0hp pokemon
* Nasty bug that caused evaluation in non-random battles to be incorrect; this should result in better performance in modes like ou
* Bugs with pokemon initialization and with searching through trapped/force-switch states
* State serialization incorrectness introduced with trickroom
* State instruction generation bugs
* Bug in get options and added some tests
* Bug where there was an attempt to decrement pp for an unknown move
* Bug with magicguard and end of turn instructions
* Bug with end of turn instructions
* Incorrect calculation for eviolite and assaultvest
* Bug where attack boosts of own pokemon affected foulplay damage it dealt (#8)
* Docker build fetch update issues (#21)
* Intimidate that should not create 0 boost
* Crash when multiattack is used by itemless pokemon
* Thunderouskick and raised valueerror if an incorrect boost is sent in
* Slowkinggalar base stats
* The stab modifier function
* Accept_challenge mode
* Gen3 move mods to use correct boost strings


### Removed

* Debug logs that werent very useful
* Opponent's guaranteed decisions when deciding the safest move
* Nonascii characters
* Caching; there is something wrong with the boost attributes of the pkmn which causes an evaluation to return a cached value when it should not
* Websocket_communicator package
* Duplicate instructions after each pair of moves
* Ditto random battle sets
* Trapped, force_switch, and wait from state
* Object identify hashes and scoriong multiplier
* Basestats from objects.pokemon
* Darmg team from ou samples
* Matchup evaluation
* Old scoring values; lower stealthrock value
* Noisy module name from logs
* Futuresight bonus in evaluation function
